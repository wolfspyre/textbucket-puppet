mount

- **atboot**
    Whether to mount the mount at boot.  Not all platforms
support this.

- **blockdevice**
    The device to fsck.  This is property is only valid
    on Solaris, and in most cases will default to the correct
value.

- **device**
    The device providing the mount.  This can be whatever
    device is supporting by the mount, including network
    devices or devices specified by UUID rather than device
    path, depending on the operating system.

- **dump**
    Whether to dump the mount.  Not all platform support this.
    Valid values are `1` or `0`. or `2` on FreeBSD, Default is `0`.  Values
    can match `/(0|1)/`, `/(0|1)/`.

- **ensure**
    Control what to do with this mount. Set this attribute to
    `umounted` to make sure the filesystem is in the filesystem table
    but not mounted (if the filesystem is currently mounted, it will be
    unmounted).  Set it to `absent` to unmount (if necessary) and remove
    the filesystem from the fstab.  Set to `mounted` to add it to the
    fstab and mount it. Set to `present` to add to fstab but not change
    mount/unmount status.  Valid values are `defined` (also called
    `present`), `unmounted`, `absent`, `mounted`.

- **fstype**
    The mount type.  Valid values depend on the
    operating system.  This is a required option.

- **name**
    The mount path for the mount.

- **options**
    Mount options for the mounts, as they would
appear in the fstab.

- **pass**
    The pass in which the mount is checked.

- **path**
    The deprecated name for the mount point.  Please use `name` now.

- **remounts**
    Whether the mount can be remounted  `mount -o remount`.  If
    this is false, then the filesystem will be unmounted and remounted
    manually, which is prone to failure.  Valid values are `true`, `false`.

- **target**
    The file in which to store the mount table.  Only used by
    those providers that write to disk.
