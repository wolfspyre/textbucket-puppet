tidy

- **age**
    Tidy files whose age is equal to or greater than
    the specified time.  You can choose seconds, minutes,
    hours, days, or weeks by specifying the first letter of any
    of those words (e.g., '1w').

Specifying 0 will remove all files.

- **backup**
    Whether tidied files should be backed up.  Any values are passed
    directly to the file resources used for actual file deletion, so consult
    the `file` type's backup documentation to determine valid values.

- **matches**
    One or more (shell type) file glob patterns, which restrict
    the list of files to be tidied to those whose basenames match
    at least one of the patterns specified. Multiple patterns can
    be specified using an array.
    
    Example:
    
        tidy { "/tmp":
          age     => "1w",
          recurse => 1,
          matches => [ "[0-9]pub*.tmp", "*.temp", "tmpfile?" ]
        }
    
    This removes files from `/tmp` if they are one week old or older,
    are not in a subdirectory and match one of the shell globs given.
    
    Note that the patterns are matched against the basename of each
    file -- that is, your glob patterns should not have any '/'
    characters in them, since you are only specifying against the last
    bit of the file.
    
    Finally, note that you must now specify a non-zero/non-false value
    for recurse if matches is used, as matches only apply to files found
    by recursion (there's no reason to use static patterns match against
    a statically determined path).  Requiering explicit recursion clears
    up a common source of confusion.

- **path** (*namevar*)
    The path to the file or directory to manage.  Must be fully
qualified.

- **recurse**
    If target is a directory, recursively descend
    into the directory looking for files to tidy.  Valid values are `true`,
    `false`, `inf`.  Values can match `/^[0-9]+$/`.

- **rmdirs**
    Tidy directories in addition to files; that is, remove
    directories whose age is older than the specified criteria.
    This will only remove empty directories, so all contained
    files must also be tidied before a directory gets removed.  Valid values
    are `true`, `false`.

- **size**
    Tidy files whose size is equal to or greater than
    the specified size.  Unqualified values are in kilobytes, but
    *b*, *k*, *m*, *g*, and *t* can be appended to specify *bytes*,
    *kilobytes*, *megabytes*, *gigabytes*, and *terabytes*, respectively.
    Only the first character is significant, so the full word can also
    be used.

- **type**
    Set the mechanism for determining age.  Valid values are `atime`,
    `mtime`, `ctime`.
